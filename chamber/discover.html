                        The iron bridge is linked to Pergamino's railway history and the demographic and commercial 
                        growth of the area. As part of this development, in 1904, the company F.C Central Argentino 
                        asked the Municipality for the authorization to close the Rocha street-level crossing, 
                        located in the middle of the twenty railway hectares in order to streamline tasks and avoid 
                        accidents with people and carriages. After a few years, the request was approved and the 
                        commitment of the railway to install a pedestrian bridge. The same was entrusted to the 
                        metallurgical ‚ÄúAndrew Handyside & C¬∫ L.‚Äù, an important supplier of railway elements, located 
                        in Derby, Great Britain, which also manufactured locomotive parts, columns for the gaslighting, 
                        and mailboxes for the post, among other things.<br><br>
                        The imposing 150-meter bridge is accompanied by a work of infrastructure, which allows 
                        connecting the city center with one of its most emblematic neighborhoods "Acevedo Neighborhood" 
                        The viaduct was inaugurated on December 5, 2005, accompanied by the establishment of Parque 
                        Espa√±a, a large green lung that is the scene of various physical, cultural, and recreational 
                        activities.

                        We continue with the machinery sheds of the old General Railway station Bartolom√© Mitre that 
                        have recently been restored and put back in value for the Installation of the Municipal School 
                        of Fine Arts. In our walk, we can find another recovered building where the Railway Museum is. 
                        The place also has a technical library with texts from the 19th century, plans, files, 
                        credentials, maps, signaling, and communication elements. It also includes a 17mt model 
                        railway table electronically controlled, in which there is a station, rotary table, machine 
                        shed, bridges, tunnels, photos, clothing, and office supplies.

                        San Nicolas street is one of the main shopping streets in the city. Its name was not put in 
                        honor of San Nicol√°s de Bari as is usually considered, but because of the city of San Nicol√°s 
                        de Los Arroyos because through this street, the people from San Nicol√°s used to enter the 
                        town, whose point of arrival and departure was the main square (Plaza Merced). In 1882, with 
                        the arrival of the railway, it became the main commercial artery of the city.

                        built in 1890. The one that can be seen today dates from between 1911 and 1913; conserving 
                        only the fa√ßade and a few meters of construction towards the interior of the original building.
                        <br><br>It still retains the bars at the entrance with its marble stairs. Upstairs, the curved 
                        balconies in the shape of a funnel, the balcony of the main room with predominant

                        French neoclassicism. It was built by Cardozo and Vera Usedio, under the project of the 
                        architects Quincke, Nin Mitchel. Located on Florida Street, an old street of commerce, which 
                        used to be Pergamino's main artery during the 17th and 19th centuries. It was there around 
                        Plaza Merced where the first institutions, families, and businesses were established.

                        First called Plaza Mayor, it currently occupies the same land as in its beginnings (1750). 
                        The importance of this square is that it was the component by which the formation of the town 
                        was guided. Around the square the Fort, the Chapel, the Parish Cemetery, the Posta were built. 
                        Around it, the first streets were opened and the first adobe and straw houses were built. Over 
                        the years, this has fulfilled the real function of a plaza, functioning as a center for 
                        official ceremonies and a place for community meetings.

                        straw, and a few pieces of wood, that was destroyed in an indigenous attack around 1751. 18 
                        years later, it was decided to build a chapel with greater capacity, which was deteriorated 
                        after a fire in 1919. From this, it was decided to build the current temple in Romanesque 
                        style.
